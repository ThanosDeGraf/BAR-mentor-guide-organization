# Hello Gamer!
Welcome. If you are reading this, it means you are doing your due diligence of gathering informing yourself. Congratulations!
I am Tuerk, and want to give you some advice that does not *quite* fit into the other categories, so just bear with me for a minute and you will be on your way.

## Your fellow Gamers and how to find them
So you want to hop on right away and duke it out, but how?

Currently, your options are a very experimental matchmaking queue hidden on a website (this one -> https://server4.beyondallreason.info/) seperate from the main website (https://www.beyondallreason.info/), and manually finding a game through the match browser. The third option is browsing the LFG channel of the BAR-Discord (https://discord.gg/beyond-all-reason), which is also the one heart of the BAR community. If people are looking to fill up their lobbies with players, it will be announced there too.

Most of the time, players will use the later option, which means that most of the time, you will have to join random open lobbies, so:

### Don't panic because you are new
Honestly! Some might feel ashamed of themselves for joining a random lobby, thinking they are holding back their team by not playing well, but that's absolutely alright.

Of course, there will be bad apples that'll get upset if they don't get seven 10 year veterans on their team, but most players are good sports and know that you will have to start from somewhere! Some might even try to give help or tips on what to do.

If you think about it like that, there is absolutely no reason to worry. Just try your best and show earnesty. You will get there.

## Also, don't panic if you get harrased by Ticks!
What I mean is that when you play your first couple of games, learning how to effectively carry out your prime directive (establishing and expanding map control), aggressive players can harrass you and it will feel like you didn't even get a chance to react.

That is also part of the process. Very soon, you will repell the first harass attempt at you, and then push your first frontline, survive or muster a T2 rush, and catch your first enemy commander by learning what options you have access to you.

You'll outgrow those moments where you felt powerless at first. Only with a little time and attention to get used to the flow, Laser Towers, Artillery, Air Defense, Radar and Jamming etc. will become tools you will use on your path to that **W**.

But, there is no shame in getting schooled by a player piling on you with a dozen scouts that costs like 15 metal each. Most everyone had that happen to them.
